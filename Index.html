      <h2> Bio: </h2><p> I am a Junior at Cristo Rey Jesuit High School. I'm interested in computer science because there is an opportunity to create and build stuff, which I enjoy a lot. I am very family oriented, I have three siblings and live with my parents. In my free time I like to dance, I am part of a Folklorico group name Brenda Lopez Folklorico Group. I'm also really interested in sports like basketball and volleyball. My goal for the future is to be an engineer and to be very successful in the engineering field.</p> <h3>Fun Fact: </h3><p> I have met Father Greg Boyle and I visited Homeboy Industries.</p><img src="Images/homeboy.jpg" id="image" onmouseover="increase_size()" onmouseout="decrease_size()"></img>
